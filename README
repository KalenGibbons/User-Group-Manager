The User Group Manager application allows user group managers to track group meetings, 
attendance, and presenters.  It also provides a simple and efficient way of randomly 
selecting raffle winners.  Raffles can be weighted based on attendance, to favor members 
that commonly attend meetings over those who just show up for the raffles.
